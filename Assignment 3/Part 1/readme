I have made several functions and the names of function pretty much tells what it does so I have given a short description in the starting of each function

To run the program:

python3 assignment3.py [filename]



Note that three address code should be of the form

line_no. Variable = Variable + Variable
line_no. Variable = Variable + Number
line_no. Variable = Variable

All combinations of above eg

1. a = b + c

5. c = 5 * b

7. c = 5



I have made 3 files named threeaddr.txt , threeaddr2.txt and threeaddr3.txt that contains 3 address codes in this format
I have also attached output files of each named output1.txt , output2.txt and output3.txt
